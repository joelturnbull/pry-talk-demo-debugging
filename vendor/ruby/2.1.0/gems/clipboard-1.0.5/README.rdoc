Access the clipboard and do not care if the OS is Linux, MacOS or Windows.

=== Usage
* <tt>Clipboard.copy</tt>
* <tt>Clipboard.paste</tt>
* <tt>Clipboard.clear</tt>

== Remarks

==== Multiple Clipboards
On Linux, you can choose from which clipboard you want to +paste+ by supplying an argumument, the default is CLIPBOARD.

+copy+ copies to all clipboards in Clipboard::CLIPBOARDS.

==== ffi Dependency
This gem depends on the ffi gem to support the Windows clipboard. However, since ffi is not plain Ruby, it cannot be installed in every Ruby environment and therefore, ffi is not a hard dependency of this gem. To ensure Windows compatibility, you can put the ffi gem in your Gemfile.

==== Windows Encoding
If you paste with 1.9, the clipboard encoding will be translated to your <tt>Encoding.default_external</tt>.

If you paste with 1.8, it will fallback to CP850 encoding.
Copying with 1.8 will fallback to the +clip+ utility, which is installed by default since Vista

==== SSH
To use the clipboard through ssh, you need to install <tt>xauth</tt> on your server and connect via <tt>ssh -X</tt> or <tt>ssh -Y</tt>. However, some server settings restrict that feature, so don't rely on it, untested.

==== Java
There is a java implementation included (<tt>Clipboard::Java</tt>) as an option for JRuby. However, on Linux, it always operates (only) on the CLIPBOARD clipboard.

=== Non-gem Requirements
* *Linux*: +xclip+ or +xsel+, you can install it on debian/ubuntu with <tt>sudo apt-get install xclip</tt>

=== TODO
* Don't depend on +xclip+/+xsel+ (no plans to implement it, though)
